        Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, more popular in India as N. T. Rama Rao, and often referred to as N T R back home
        in the south, was one of the most popular actors that has ever graced the South Indian film industry. N. T. Rama Rao
        had been a part of mostly Telugu films, but he has also starred in some popular Tamil and Kannada ventures during
        the second half of his film career. N T R portrayed lead roles and negative characters with equal panache and later
        shifted his attention to producing and directing films for the Telugu film industry. While his stint in Tollywood made
        him a legend in Andhra Pradesh, N. T. Rama Rao remained equally popular among the masses even after he retired from
        films and became a politician. N. T. Rama Rao had a very significant political career graph during which he tried his
        best to introduce policies for the well being of his state Andhra Pradesh.

        <summary>Early Life</summary>
        <p>N. T. Rama Rao was born on May 28, 1923 in the Nimmakuru village of Andhra Pradesh.
            Although his father was a farmer, the family was quite well-to-do and led a fairly
            lavish lifestyle. N. T. Rama Rao completed his primary years of schooling in Nimmakuru,
            later shifting to Vijayawada where he lived with an uncle who had adopted him. He attended
            a school in Vijayawada from his sixth standard. However, the tables of fortune soon turned and
            N. T. Rama Rao's family could no longer be classified as rich. It was at this time that he took
            up his first job as a milk delivery boy in Vijayawada. He also became the clerk of a local
            provisional store. N. T. Rama Rao continued with his studies until he reached his twenties
            and was then a student of the Andhra University. It is said that N. T. Rama Rao possessed a
            lovely voice and was often found singing to himself during his youth. But destiny had some
            other plans for the actor who quit his first job in the civil services of India to enter
            as an actor in the Telugu film industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Acting always interested N. T. Rama Rao and he actively became a member of college plays and
            other stage shows while still in college. According to reports, the first role that was offered
            to N T R in a college play was that of a female. Though he agreed to portray the role, he was
            reluctant to part with his moustache! Most of the plays organized by him during this point of
            time were done to generate funds to serve the poor and ailing in the society. A young man in
            his twenties, his journey to stardom had just begun. What followed thereafter made
            N. T. Rama Rao a legend, making a place for him on the pages of Andhra Pradesh history.
            Meanwhile, the future legendary Tollywood actor had already tied the knot with the love
            of his life Basava Tarakam, the daughter of his maternal uncle, in the year 1942. Despite
            being a good student during his school years, an early married life led him to fail in a number
            of subjects in college. Nevertheless, N. T. Rama Rao was a determined student who never gave up
            on education despite repeated failures.

        <summary>Career in Films</summary>
        <p>The year 1947 marked N. T. Rama Rao's entry into the world of Telugu cinema.
            It was B. A. Subba Rao, a very well known producer of films made in South India,
            who first noticed the legend in the making N. T. Rama Rao. B A Subba Rao was so taken
            by the photograph of N. T. Rama Rao that he did not think twice before signing him as the
            hero for his upcoming film 'Palleturi Pilla'. N. T. Rama Rao did not have to go through the
            routine of a screen test and make up test for his debut performance on the big screen.
            Though he was signed for B A Subba Rao's film first, N. T. Rama Rao's first onscreen
            venture was a tiny part of a policeman in the 1949 L V Prasad film 'Mana Desam'. 'Palleturi Pilla',
            a film inspired from the English play 'Pizaro' went on to become a huge commercial hit in theaters
            across South India and won this talented actor much recognition. But times were hard for an actor
            during those days. Ever since N. T. Rama Rao had shifted base to Madras and taken up a rented space
            there to live close to his workplace, it became difficult for him to make end's meet with the money
            that he received as remuneration from films. N. T. Rama Rao also had to go without food for many
            days to save money.
        </p>
        <p>If year 1949 was good for N. T. Rama Rao, year 1951 was even better because it saw the release of K. V.
            Reddy's film 'Paathala Bhairavi' and B. N. Reddy's production 'Malleeswari'. The former was a raging
            hit all over India and it was from here that the common man sat up and took notice of N. T. Rama Rao who
            was gradually making a place for himself in Tollywood and in the hearts of his fans. In the above mentioned
            film and in several others succeeding them, he was most often seen in the role of a legendary historic
            character or a common man hero. It was only in a handful of films that he played a negative character.
            The popularity of N. T. Rama Rao gradually increased and more producers were eager to work with him.
            In the year 1958, N. T. Rama Rao bagged the role of Ravana Brahma in the film 'Bhoo Kailas'. The actor
            was more than happy to play the character because in the word of N. T. Rama Rao, Ravana was the best
            historical mythological character that he had read or heard about. In 1960 was released the first
            mythological film starring N. T. Rama Rao in the lead. 'Sri Madvirata Parvam' was based on the story
            of Lord Venkateswara who is a much loved deity in South India. The common man did not flinch from
            lining up outside theaters playing the film in odd hours of the day to watch their favorite actor
            N. T. Rama Rao.

        <summary>Later Career</summary>
        <p>
          Just like the popularity of N. T. Rama Rao as an actor increased, his remuneration also went up.
            His films 'Lava Kusa' and 'Maya Bazar' were record hits at the box office, breaking all previous
            records. N. T. Rama Rao remained an actor for more than 40 years of his life, giving his audience

        <summary>Career in Politics</summary>
        <p>It was during the 1980s that N. T. Rama Rao retired from films to take up politics actively.
            Even when he was a part of the film industry, he always strived hard to convince the government
            to set up theaters in rural regions of Andhra Pradesh. He was one of the proponents of a governing
            system that would provide large sums of money for the proper production and distribution of movies.
            Therefore, it wouldn't be unfair to say that a politician was always hidden within N. T. Rama Rao.
            He set up the Telugu Desam Party in the year 1982, following which N. T. Rama Rao was elected the
            Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh three times between the years 1983 to 1994. In between, N. T. Rama Rao
            became the leader of the Telugu Dasam Legislature Party in 1983. N. T. Rama Rao believed that politicians
            should develop direct contacts with the common man and therefore, he made extensive journeys across the
            state of Andhra Pradesh to promote his Telugu Desam Party.
            The journey was made on a personal van named 'Chaitanya Ratham'.

        </p>
        <p>N. T. Rama Rao advocated for the cause of the poor in the society and to provide them with the
            basic necessities. He was also a champion for the cause of women's rights in Andhra Pradesh.
            The bill which he proposed allowing women to inherit ancestral property was enacted in the year 1986.
            N. T. Rama Rao was such a popular politician that his Telugu Desam Party posed a threat to the existence
            of the Congress party in India. In the year 1984, N. T. Rama Rao was removed from the office of Andhra Pradesh
            Chief Minister following the threat, though he won back his position later. It was during the era of
            N. T. Rama Rao that the Telugu Desam Party established itself as one of the strongest and most organized
            political parties in the country. The party was systematic in its operations and all the work was computerized
            even during that age, factors responsible for the Telugu Desam Party's existence even after the death of founder
            N. T. Rama Rao. N. T. Rama Rao was unanimously elected the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1994 in spite
            of the fact that he could not contest the elections owing to bad health. N. T. Rama Rao had suffered a stroke
            in 1989 after which his health deteriorated considerably.
